            <h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
            <p>Poverty in Indonesia is more than just a statistic. It is a daily struggle for millions of people who fight to survive without basic needs like food, clean water, education, or healthcare.  </p><br>
            <p>Behind the numbers are real stories: children walking miles to school, families living in fragile shelters, and parents working tirelessly yet earning barely enough to feed their loved ones. While the nation has made progress, deep-rooted inequality and limited opportunities continue to trap many in a cycle of hardship.</p><br>
            <p>Ending poverty in Indonesia is not just an economic goal. It is a moral responsibility to ensure every citizen has the chance to live with dignity and hope.</p>

            <h2>Why ?</h2>
            <p>Poverty in Indonesia happens for many painful and complex reasons. For countless families, it begins the moment they are born into environments with little access to quality education, healthcare, or decent jobs. In rural areas, people often depend on farming, but unstable weather and poor infrastructure make survival uncertain. In crowded cities, many live in slums, struggling to earn enough through informal, low-paying work.</p><br>
            <p>Inequality also plays a big role. Some regions thrive while others are left behind. Corruption, limited access to resources, and a lack of support systems make it even harder for the poor to break free from the cycle. Natural disasters, which hit Indonesia often, can wipe out what little they have overnight.</p><br>
            <p>Poverty here isn't just about lacking money. It's about broken dreams, lost potential, and the pain of knowing that hard work doesn't always lead to a better life. And that's what makes it so heartbreaking.</p>
